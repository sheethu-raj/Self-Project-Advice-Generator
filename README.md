# Self-Project-Advice-Generator
This is a small project I tried working on using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It's basically an advice generator that generates advice each time  a button is pressed.
It makes use of Javascript to fetch the various advices from an external api that provides the advices and updates them in the box container.
